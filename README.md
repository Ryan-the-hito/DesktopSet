My Mac desktop right now looks like this:

The picture above shows the app which widgets belong to, and their specific names. You can find all these config files regarding their names in folder “Mac” in this repository. 

- air-quality.widget
	- A widget to show the AQI.
- AirPods.widget
	- It shows battery state when you connect AirPods to your Mac.
- BatteryCharge.widget
	- Shows the battery state of your Mac.
- bluetooth-battery-bar.widget
	- Shows the battery state of Apple bluetooth devices, like the Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad. I only have these two so I make two bars in it. You can customize it according to your devices.
- quotes.widget
	- I used it for the dashed lines to fill up the right side, making the whole picture balanced in weight.
- Today.widget
	- Shows you today’s date and it’s big enough. I like it.
- useful-info.widget
	- Displays some important info so you don’t need to check them in Terminal.

The wallpaper is here, alongside its working file in pxd. You can download and open it using Pixelmator Pro:

Most of the widget config I used from Übersicht are in MIT license so I will keep that.

Thanks for all those widget configs. Without all these, I cannot remake the whole set for my computer.♥‿♥
